          <h4 class="item-txt">The Beautiful Outdoors</h4>
          <p>
            Buffalo has numerous outdoor activities to keep you busy, including
            the Olmsted Park System, which is comprised of 6 parks, 7 parkways,
            8 circles and several smaller spaces. The Buffalo Olmsted Park
            System is our nation's first system of parks, parkways and circles,
            and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
